# Nothing Theme (2) / Nebula

**Unleash Yourself**. Nothing Theme (2) is here. Improved. Changed. Redesigned. 

Nothing Theme (2) is a major successor to Nothing Theme (1), with a new, more readable, font, while also keeping the Dot Matrix Font. The theme also uses round corners to soften, and to make the theme more approachable.

Nothing Theme (2) comes in two different forms. The Red and White (WIP) versions. Which will be available for download!
